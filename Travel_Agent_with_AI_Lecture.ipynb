The annual monsoon rains usually begin in late May or June and last until September. Arts fans should consider a winter visit to coincide with the annual Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, which runs for nine days, starting on the first Saturday of February.Getting aroundMumbai is well-served by train, with an extensive rail network that connects different neighborhoods from north to south. Auto rickshaws and taxis are also good options; using the meter is standard practice in Mumbai, so you won’t have to worry about negotiating a fee. Both can easily be hailed off the street or booked using ride-hailing apps such as Ola Cabs.Traveler tipsIf you want to try an array of delicious Indian specialties in Mumbai, make a beeline to Chetana Veg Restaurant in South Mumbai’s Kala Ghoda neighborhood. The restaurant is known for its thali, a complete meal featuring a smattering of dishes on one large plate. Expect copious amounts of bread, rice, vegetable curries, and lentil dishes, along with a selection of desserts. There’s also a small bookstore attached to the restaurant that sells titles on topics ranging from Indian philosophy to Ayurvedic medicine.\n",

Although Margot will always be a Dilliwalli at heart, she secretly loves Mumbai just as much.The first thing you should do in Mumbai is... have a meal at one of the famed Parsi cafés. These iconic restaurants were founded by Parsis (Zoroastrians whose ancestors immigrated to India) and have their own distinct cuisine and ambiance.A perfect Saturday in Mumbai... starts with a morning boat trip out to the cave temples at Elephanta Island, is followed by an afternoon visit to the seafront Haji Ali Mosque, and ends with a sunset and people-watching at Chowpatty Beach.One touristy thing that lives up to the hype is... Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. This gorgeous railway station is one of the best examples of the Indo-Saracenic architecture style in the world, earning it a well-deserved place on the UNESCO World Heritage list.). This gorgeous railway station is one of the best examples of the Indo-Saracenic architecture style in the world, earning it a well-deserved place on the UNESCO World Heritage list.To discover the \"real\" Mumbai... get out of the touristy South Mumbai Colaba and Fort neighborhoods and head up to residential areas such as chic Bandra West or historic Mahim.For the best view of the city... head over to Marine Drive, also known as the Queen's Necklace because the lights that line the street resemble a string of pearls after dark.One thing people get wrong... is that they equate Mumbai with Dharavi, the slum area portrayed in Slumdog Millionaire. Mumbai is incredibly diverse when it comes to everything from architecture to religion to lifestyles, and no one part of town can properly represent the city.see moresee lessEN60d01f5a-013a-4b30-825d-784f811bce65geo_hubPeople Also AskWhat is Mumbai famous for?Mumbai mixes modern-day India with nuggets of its colonial period.

      "The insider advice on this page is from two of Wendy’s Trusted Travel Experts for India: Bertie and Victoria Dyer.\n",
      "Trusted Travel Expert\n",
      "Bertie and Victoria Dyer\n",
      "Bertie Dyer fell in love with India at age 12 and has spent as much time as possible there since. He and his wife, Victoria, lived for ten years in Jaipur, where they were married and had their first child. The company they started together, which arranges private journeys to India, grew out of their desire to introduce visiting friends to the people and places they love in Rajasthan, and today they specialize in unique trips tailored to individual interests—a type of travel experience that is rare in India, where most tours emphasize ticking off as many main sites as possible. Bertie’s areas of expertise include Moghul architecture, wildlife photography, and Indian history. Victoria’s passions include yoga, Indian cooking, and textile design—and her knowledge of boutiques and bazaars has made her Jaipur shop crawl one of their most popular tours. Bertie and Victoria split their time between their home in India and the U.K. Their Jaipur office is run by a dedicated team of local employees who have been with the company from the beginning.\n",
      " Contact Bertie and Victoria \n",
      "Read Trip Reviews\n",
      "Expect trips orchestrated by Bertie and Victoria to start at $750 per day for two travelers, utilizing 4-star hotels, a private car and driver, and a private guide.\n",

      "Where to Stay\n",
      "Best bang-for-your-buck hotel\n",
      "Overlooking the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea, the Taj Mahal Palace is a Mumbai institution. (Don’t miss the views from the hotel’s Harbour Bar, Mumbai’s first licensed drinking establishment.) The Tower rooms are smaller and decorated more simply, but rates can be half that of the Palace wing, which has been refurbished to retain its 1950s/60s heritage feel; Bertie and Victoria’s travelers receive upgrades when available.\n",
      "The Taj Mahal Palace hotel has rooms in both an older Palace wing and a newer tower.\n",
      "Where to Eat and Drink\n",
      "Restaurants the locals love\n",
      "Mumbai is famous for its seafood, and Trishna is the place to try the vast array of fresh seafood hauled onto the docks just down the road. Try the butter garlic crab served with roomali roti, a very thin bread.\n",
      "Bombay Canteen is modern, funky, and fun. Order the tandoori pork, which is slow-cooked twice and comes with a glaze of spicy jaggery (a South Asian sugar), topped off with pickled cucumber and onion carrot slaw.\n",
      "When you want a break from spices and curry, head to The Table for delicious garlic and truffle fries and other Western dishes.\n",
      "Britannia & Co. is a vintage classic built in the early 1920s by George Wittet, the architect who designed the Gateway of India. Go for the traditional Parsi cuisine and old-world cafeteria vibe.\n",
      "Dishes to try\n",
      "Vada pav is Mumbai’s signature street food: a spicy potato deep-fried and then served in a soft bread roll.\n",
      "Bombay duck. Confusingly, this is not actually duck, but a scary looking fish, best eaten fried. Trishna (see above) does a particularly good version.\n",
      "Meals worth the splurge\n",
      "Ziya, the flagship restaurant at the Oberoi Nariman Point hotel. Famed for his revolutionary Indian cuisine, executive chef Vineet Bhatia was the first Indian chef to be awarded a Michelin star (he now has two). The restaurant overlooks Marine Drive, and a table by the window gives you the best views of the bay. If you’re going all out, order the Ziya Gourmand Vault Menu, an exquisite seven-course tasting menu.\n",
      "For a true gastronomic journey, splurge on the ten-course tasting menu at Masque. Using locally sourced ingredients and preparing them with international techniques, the team at Masque blends flavors in ways you’ve never imagined. The seasonal menu changes every few months.\n",
      "Pit stops\n",
      "Read Gregory David Roberts’ bestselling novel Shantaram (or watch the Apple TV+ series), and then head to the brilliantly featured Leopold Café. Leopold has a buzzy, vibrant atmosphere and is a fun place to take in the local Colaba scene.\n",
      "For the young at heart, the hip-and-happening suburb of Lower Parel is home to great bars and restaurants (including Bombay Canteen, a favorite of Victoria and Bertie’s) and fabulous shopping. Don’t miss the Good Earth home-goods store and café either.\n",
      "Things to See and Do\n",
      "One of Mumbai’s most underrated spots is inside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Photo: India Beat\n",
      "Most underrated place\n",
      "The Great Indian Peninsular Museum, inside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly known as the Victoria Terminus Railway Station), tells the story of India’s vast railway network and gives you behind-the-scenes access to this extraordinary building, renowned for its combination of Gothic and Indian architecture. In addition to visiting the private administrative areas, you’ll also get to enjoy a great viewpoint overlooking the platforms.\n",
      "Most overrated place\n",
      "The Hanging Gardens (also known as Ferozeshah Metha) are not worth the effort to get there, and you can have better views of the city from one of Mumbai’s rooftop bars.\n",
      "Don’t miss\n",
      "Make the most of being in the cricket capital of India and head to Wankhede Stadium, the home ground of the Mumbai cricket team, to watch regularly hosted one-day internationals and test matches.\n",
      "If glitz and glamour are more to your taste, head to the flagship store of Sabyasachi. Sabyasachi Mukherjee is a Kolkata-based designer who changed the face of Indian fashion. The Mumbai store is housed in a neoclassical building, originally built for a British bank, that now features over 150 works of art, 100 chandeliers, 275 carpets, 3,000 books, a tearoom, and some of the most dazzling saris and lehengas you will ever see. For jewels to complement these outfits (or some of your own), check out The Gem Palace Boutique, which brings Jaipur’s legendary Gem Palace jewels to Colaba.\n",
      "Colaba’s art galleries showcase the dynamic and evolving nature of Indian art. From heritage spaces such as NGMA and the Jahangir Art Gallery to experimental and contemporary galleries such as Chatterjee & Lal and Project 88, Colaba is a must-visit for those interested in modern and avant-garde art forms.\n",
      "Top tours\n",
      "Mumbai is a living museum of architectural history. With a skyline that speaks to colonial grandeur, Art Deco elegance, and Indo-Saracenic splendor, the city is a captivating blend of old and new. Explore the mix of Gothic Revival, Victorian, Art Deco, and contemporary design on a specialist-guided architectural walk.\n",
      "A lesser known but fascinating aspect of Mumbai is its vibrant Jewish heritage. The Jewish community has been an integral part of Mumbai’s social and cultural fabric for centuries, bestowing a rich legacy of synagogues and traditions that continue to thrive today. On Victoria and Bertie’s Jewish heritage guided walk, you’ll discover hidden synagogues, learn the stories of Jewish merchants and industrialists, and view the architectural gems they left behind.\n",
      "Bertie and Victoria love to shop! Their highly curated shopping crawl of Mumbai takes you to the city’s most beautiful jewelry and fashion stores, antiques shops, and into the must-see bazaars and markets. One of their favorites is the famous Thief’s Market—chor in Hindi means thief. It is said that this market was originally called Shor Bazaar (meaning noisy market), however it was mispronounced by the British as Chor Bazaar, a name later vindicated as illegal and stolen goods found their way into the market. This bazaar is located in a Muslim area (so dress conservatively) and is a bustling hive of shopping activity—though today, goods tend to be second-hand rather than stolen.\n",
      "Early-morning activities in Mumbai. Photo: India Beat\n",
      "Tour Mumbai at dawn. Seeing this lively city wake up provides you with an understanding of the real Mumbai, one that goes beyond the glamour and skyscrapers of the Colaba district. Go to the Sassoon Docks to watch the fishing boats come in, then to the auction where the early-morning catch is sold. Afterward, you can watch the newspaper sorting that takes place on the streets before heading to the vegetable and flower bazaars; you will start to understand the logistics of the city’s food distribution as 100 tons of meat, fruit, and vegetables enter the various markets. When you walk the same lanes just a few hours later, you won’t find any evidence of the morning’s activities.\n",
      "Diggi Rathore works alongside Bertie and Victoria and knows Mumbai like no other. Charming, fun, and an excellent Bollywood dancer, Diggi’s passion for life is contagious and he will quickly absorb you into the local scene. This could be at the Royal Western Indian Turf Club to watch horse racing (the Indian Derby is one of the most glamorous events in the Indian calendar), at Bademiya (his favorite food stall), or for drinks at Social in Colaba.\n",
      "Hidden gem\n",
      "The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, is dedicated to the city’s decorative and industrial arts. The ornate Victorian building is a fine example of colonial-era architecture and was originally intended to act as the Indian version of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum.\n",
      "Cheap thrill\n",
      "Explore Worli Village and Mumbai’s spice market. Worli is home to the Kohli community, the original inhabitants of the Mumbai area. Today they are still fishermen, and this traditional village feels like it’s a million miles away from the city—even though it’s right in the center of Mumbai’s skyscrapers. Visit the fish market and walk up to the Worli Fort before heading over to the spice market, about 20 minutes away, where it’s fascinating to see the pounding machines and the local ladies instructing the vendors on their preferred blend.\n",
      "How to spend a lazy Sunday\n",
      "Sunday is the best day to walk in the city, as it’s the quietest. Start in Colaba at the Gateway of India: Have brunch at the Taj Mahal Palace before walking up Chattrapati Shivaji Road to catch a movie at the art deco Regal Cinema. Alternatively, check out the National Gallery of Modern Art or the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya Museum, further up on Mahatma Gandhi Road. Heading north from either the cinema or the museums, you will see several more of Mumbai’s architectural gems before reaching the Oval Maidan gardens, where locals gather to play cricket on Sundays.\n",
      "You might also head to Juhu, a neighborhood that combines luxury, culture, and a dash of Bollywood glamour. Start with a peaceful walk along sandy Juhu Beach before heading to the Sea Lounge at the Taj Lands End for coffee and pastries and stunning sea views. Then visit ISKCON, a magnificent temple complex and spiritual oasis. Enjoy a long lunch at the Olive Bar and Kitchen. In the afternoon, explore the vibrant arts scene by catching a performance or simply soaking in the atmosphere at the intimate and artsy Prithvi Theatre. Revive with coffee and a light snack in the shade of a tree at the charming Prithvi Café. Later, explore the area’s high-end boutiques (Victoria likes Nicobar for contemporary Indian fashion and Fizzy Goblet for handcrafted designer footwear). End your day with sundowners at AER Lounge in the Four Seasons hotel; this rooftop bar offers breathtaking views of Mumbai’s skyline and the Arabian Sea. Sip on a craft cocktail and soak up the gorgeous sunset.\n",

      "Best Time to Go\n",
      "October to March. During the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, held every February, the city is packed with events, exhibitions, and huge art installations.\n",
      "Worst Time to Go\n",
      "June to September is the monsoon season. The city sometimes flood, making it impossible to get anywhere, and the rain can be so heavy that it’s like standing under a shower.\n",
      "Biggest Rookie Mistakes\n",
      "Trying to fight the traffic; plan carefully to avoid it altogether if possible. For example, if you arrive in Mumbai during rush hour, break up the journey to your hotel by stopping en-route for a tour of Dharavi, a former fishing village that is now one of Asia’s largest slums; in spite of the inevitable dirt and apparent chaos, Dharavi is the most bustling part of Mumbai, and a prime contributor to the city’s GDP. While the word “slum” describes a place of poverty and hardship, it is also used to describe a place of enterprise, humor, and nonstop activity. Bertie and Victoria’s travelers visit the commercial areas of the slum—not the residential ones—so you will see factories, workshops, tanneries, recycling centers, and even a showroom where you can purchase leather goods.\n",
      "Not making arrangements for private guides ahead of time: Because of the cruise ships that dock at Mumbai from October to April, there is high demand for guides on certain days.\n",
      "Scam to Avoid\n",
      "Taxis at the airport are notorious for trying to take tourists for a ride; only get in a car that you have pre-booked.\n",
      "Bragging Rights\n",
      "Bertie and Victoria can arrange a visit to Mr. Alim, a revered movie-poster artist, who will create an original Bollywood-style poster featuring you as the star.\n",
      "Prime Picnic Spot\n",
      "Join the throngs of walkers on Chowpatty Beach for an evening stroll, picking up some street-food snacks along the way. It’s the perfect place for people-watching.\n",
      "The Souvenirs\n",
      "Head to the Mutton Street market for vintage Bollywood posters and ship-related antiques—portholes from cruise liners, polished brass handles from luxury yachts, old maps, and more.\n",
      "Can't-Miss Photo Ops\n",
      "The view of the city from Worli Fort, an incredible panorama encompassing the Bandra-Worli Bridge, the skyscrapers of downtown Mumbai, and the traditional fishing village of Worli.\n",
      "The view from the terrace of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Get some great shots of this iconic building and shoot a time-lapse video of the crazy traffic below! The terrace is only accessible between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays with a ticket to the museum (see “Most underrated place”).\n",
      "Must-Have App\n",
      "Zomato, for finding good restaurants.\n",
      "Airport Intel\n",
      "Check out the amazing art installation in Terminal 2; it’s truly museum-quality, with more than 7,000 pieces of artwork and artifacts from all over India.\n",
      "Tipping Tip\n",
      "Ten percent is standard at restaurants; more and more places are now including a service charge on the bill—in which case you don’t have to add a tip—so be sure to check.\n",
      "Don't Forget to Pack\n",
      "Don’t wear sandals or open-toed shoes, particularly when visiting the markets—the streets are occasionally less than immaculate!\n",

      "1. **Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum**: This lesser-known museum in Byculla is Mumbai's oldest and showcases the city's decorative and industrial arts. Housed in a Victorian building, it is often overshadowed by more famous attractions but offers a unique glimpse into Mumbai's rich history.\n",
      "\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tHello - We're ending a cruise in Mumbai and would like to see the city post cruise. Could someone please guide me to a good first class hotel and neighborhood? Ideally, we'd like to walk out the front door of the hotel and explore by foot. We do not object to hiring transport occasionally, but exploring and dining within walking distance of the hotel are ideal. And lastly, how many nights do you suggest in Mumbai? (see major sites, market, and any must go to restaurants). Thanks!!\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tCaliNurse has given you some wonderful suggestions for a visit to Mumbai. I’d recommend at least 2 full days in Mumbai, 3 would be even better, to take in some of the important sights. And, as CaliNurse suggests, hiring a guide and driver to take you around for at least part of the time would be worthwhile. It’s a large, spread out city and it would be a challenge to navigate it in your own. \n",
      "And just a small correction - we stayed in the newer part of the historic Taj Mahal Palace and Tower (and upgraded to a suite!), but were able to access the historic part of the hotel as well. It’s a wonderful hotel overlooking the Gateway of India and the waterfront. There is also a poignant memorial to the victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that occurred at the hotel. \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tTaj Mahal Palace Heritage wing has some excellent rooms overlooking the Arabian sea. The higher category club rooms have excess to the lounge as well. The Heritage wing is several notches above the newer wing called 'tower'. The hotel is located in Colaba opposite the Gateway of India. Another very nice property, on the marine drive, is The Oberoi Mumbai...lovely views from your room of the 'Queen's necklace'! Next door to it is The Trident Nariman Point a much more affordable but equally nice place for a couple of nights!\n",
      "Sassoon Docks will be interesting early in the morning when the fishing trawlers arrive with their loads.Gandhi Museum, Church gate for the Dabbawallahs, Dhobi ghat are some interesting places for sightseeing other then some other recounted by above posters. The Colaba causeway markets & Chor Bazzaar has some fine outlets for home ware & clothing. \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tThe city tourist authority arranges a good tour by bus at a modest cost. The main museum, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, (CSMVS) and a similarly named main rail station formerly Victoria or commonly VT should not be missed. Mumbai is not much for \"sites\" and is a place for a moneybelt IMHO with one exception. If you are a bit adventurous and agile and if the sea is not rough then the Elaphanta ruins are a must-see. Quite an adventure. I am glad I was young then and could jump from the boat to the dock. If you get a driver I suggest having him drive you to places the tourists don't go to. That is what the city actually is. If he is creative you will have a memory that will stick. I have had some wonderful mad experiences that way, wandering through spice markets, and homes, looking from rooftops. Just smile and say namaste. India can be an amazingly welcoming joy. One fellow said I know you are CIA. I said I'll wander on. He said, no we are having our biggest demonstration of the year tomorrow and you must come. I did and had dinner with his family also.
